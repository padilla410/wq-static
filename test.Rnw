\begin{block}{Abstract}
\alert{Eight macrophyte indicators were estimated in 23 Minnesota (USA) lakes using four years of surveys to quantify sampling and temporal variation, response to development (phosphorus) and climate stress (growing degree days), and power to detect significant change at various annual sampling intervals.  Indicators included a macrophyte index of biotic integrity, floristic quality index, maximum depth of growth, total species richness, common species richness, species per survey point, and frequency occurrence of rooted species and Chara sp.  Regression and smoothed additive models indicated significant relationships of indicators to lake phosphorus and mean annual growing degree days.  The macrophyte index of biotic integrity, floristic quality index, and the frequency rooted species had minimal sampling variation, were responsive to development or climate stress, and had low annual variation resulting in high to moderate power for detecting significant change.  Results from these analyses will facilitate the use of precise and powerful indicators that respond to stressors that are of concern for the management of freshwater glacial lakes.}

\begin{block}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Biotic integrity, floristic quality, and frequency rooted were least variable and had the highest estimated power
\item Species-specific indicators, such as Chara, were highly variable and had lower power  
\item All indicators were related to growing degree days, whereas total phosphorus was a significant predictor for maximum depth and frequency rooted 
\end{itemize}
